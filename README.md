# MultiSelectDropdown React Component

The MultiSelectDropdown React component is a customizable and user-friendly dropdown input that allows users to select multiple items from a predefined list. It includes features such as dynamic filtering, item selection, chip creation, and chip removal.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Filtering:** When you click on the input field, a dropdown list of items will appear.

2. **Autocomplete:** As you type in the input field, the dropdown list dynamically adjusts to show only items that match the entered text.

3. **Item Selection:** Clicking on an item in the dropdown list will turn it into a chip at the top of the component.

4. **Chip Management:** Once an item becomes a chip, it is removed from the dropdown list, preventing duplicate selections.

5. **Chip Removal:** Each chip includes an "X" icon. Clicking the "X" icon removes the chip and adds the corresponding item back to the dropdown list.
